The application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fetch data from the movie database API and display all categories along with the names of all movies within each category.
HTML is used for structuring the application's user interface, defining elements such as headers, lists, and containers.
CSS is utilized to style the HTML elements, ensuring a visually appealing presentation of the application.
JavaScript serves as the programming language that interacts with the movie database API, making asynchronous requests to retrieve data. Upon receiving the API response, JavaScript dynamically populates the HTML elements with the fetched movie information, organizing them into their respective categories.
